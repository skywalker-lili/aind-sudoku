# Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree
## Introductory Project: Diagonal Sudoku Solver

# Question 1 (Naked Twins)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the naked twins problem?  
A: Naked twins is similar to one choice strategy in that it also eliminates possible numbers in peers. The only difference is that the peers need to be the intersection of two twins. To identify peers, first find the naked twins while iterating through each unit, once found a pair, it's easy to find the intersection of their peers. Then it's the exactly same as in one choice strategy.

# Question 2 (Diagonal Sudoku)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the diagonal sudoku problem?  
A: The diagonal Sudoku adds two constraints. Since the contraints works by units, these two new constraints can be included automatically by adding two units corresponding diagonals.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3**.

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 
Please try using the environment we provided in the Anaconda lesson of the Nanodegree.

##### Optional: Pygame

Optionally, you can also install pygame if you want to see your visualization. If you've followed our instructions for setting up our conda environment, you should be all set.

If not, please see how to download pygame [here](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml).

### Code
